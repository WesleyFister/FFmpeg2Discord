Frustrated by manually using ffmepg to compress videos to get around Discord's 25 MiB file size limit, I wrote a simple python script that should automate the process. It could use some work however for now it get's the job done. This script works for both Windows and Linux systems assuming that you have Python and the dependancies installed.

Getting started:
pip install -r requirements.txt
